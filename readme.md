This my program to plan my day I used HTML, CSS, and javascript and jQuary for that to make it happen.
It is a really helpful planner for all us to keep in track our busy life.
The jQury help me to make my program simple.
I made rows and coloumn by using html tags and bootstraps.
I styled my page as the present time is orange and past time as red and future time as green that alert the user about the plan in a glance.
In javascript, declared variables and assigned valus for that and by using moment.js created the current time in the header session.
Then I loop through the time for all the possibilities and if it is arranged the catogory to past, present, future and assigned colour for all the classes.
Added all the plans in to the local storage and created and array for that.
used click event by usig jQury to save the plans in a local storage.
This all the function will execute only when the document is ready and this can be possible by using jQury.
